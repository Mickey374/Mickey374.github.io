Shortly after graduating from [University of Education, Winneba](https://www.uew.edu.gh/), I pursued a 3-month Data Engineering course at [Blossom Academy](https://www.blossomacademy.co/) where I worked on real-time projects like Data Warehousing , Apache Spark, ETL Pipelines, Web Scraping, among others. Also, I completed an Artificial Intelligence training at [Ghana Tech Lab's]("https://ghana-tech-lab.appspot.com/") for 6-months which birthed a startup am co-founding, Diagnosify, a health startup that uses AI to diagnose skin disease and connects you to dermatologists.
